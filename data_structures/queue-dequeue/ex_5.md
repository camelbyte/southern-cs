- **Sequence (a):** `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`  
  **Possible** – This sequence follows the exact order of arrival and perfectly aligns with the FIFO nature of a queue. Each element is dequeued immediately after being enqueued, making it valid and uniquely achievable.

- **Sequence (b):** `4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1`  
  **Not possible** – Elements like 4, 6, and 8 are dequeued before 0, 1, 2, and 3, which means earlier elements would have to be skipped — something that a queue does not allow.

- **Sequence (c):** `2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0`  
  **Not possible** – To dequeue 2 first, you would have to bypass 0 and 1, which is not allowed in a queue. The sequence requires access to non-front elements.

- **Sequence (d):** `4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9`  
  **Not possible** – Although it seems orderly, dequeuing 4 before 0–3 would require skipping the first few enqueued elements. In a queue, you must remove earlier items first, making this sequence invalid.

**Conclusion:** Only sequence **(a)** is achievable using a queue operating under FIFO rules.
